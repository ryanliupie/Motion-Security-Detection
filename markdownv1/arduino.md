## What is an Arduino?

  An Arduino is a small and simple computer that allows you to create projects requiring minimal computing power. It takes inputs and converts them into outputs. For example, imagine pressing a big red button—   
  what might happen? In my mind, I imagine a nuclear rocket launching, just like in the movies.

  Now, think about a daily activity, like pressing a button on your coffee machine in the morning. You push the button, and the machine hums to life. Water heats up, passes through the coffee grounds, and within minutes, you have your cup of coffee. That one simple action leads to a series of results—just like how an Arduino processes inputs to create outputs in projects.
