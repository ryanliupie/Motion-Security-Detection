  A Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor is a device used to detect infrared radiation, which is essentially heat emitted by objects. In simple terms, anything that produces heat—like humans, animals, and even plants—     emits infrared radiation. Understanding infrared radiation is important across various fields. For example, engineers use infrared technology to ensure safety and structural integrity, while doctors rely on       infrared imaging to analyze heat patterns in the body, helping them make more informed diagnoses.
