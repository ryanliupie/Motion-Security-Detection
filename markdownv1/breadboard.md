## What is a breadboard?

  A breadboard is similar to IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). Just as IaaS provides essential infrastructure like servers, storage, and networking that allows users to build applications, a breadboard offers     the framework for building and testing circuits.

  The board consists of the <b> bus strip </b> the <b> terminal strip </b>. The <b> bus strip </b> is like two long roads on the breadboard. One road is for electricity (VCC), and the other road is for ground (GND). The VCC road is usually red, and the GND road is usually blue or black. These roads help connect power to all the parts of your circuit so everything can work. No matter where you plug something into the breadboard, it can easily get power or ground from these roads.

  The <b> terminal strip </b> is divided into two sides by a long notch in the middle of the board. Both sides of the breadboard are where you build your circuit. Itâ€™s made up of many small holes arranged in columns. Inside, each hole in a column is connected, so when you plug in wires or components, they can "talk" to each other. This is where you connect parts like LEDs, resistors, and sensors to make your project work.
