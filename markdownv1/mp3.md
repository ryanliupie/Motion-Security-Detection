The MP3 player or MPEG audio layer 3 simply plays your musical audio files. To elaborate, this device uses a form of lossy compression, which reduces the file size by removing parts of audio data that are less likely to be noticed by the average listener. This makes the files much smaller, allowing you to download many, but there is a trade off: you lose some audio quality compared to uncompressed formats such as WAV or FLAC.
