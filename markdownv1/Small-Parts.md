 The <b> Orange wire </b> has a male and female end also known as jumper wire. The male end can plug into various components including microcontroller pin headers, breadboards, or female-ended wires. Contrary, the female end can connect to a pin or a male header on a rasberry pi and an arduino.

  The <b> Red wire </b> is also a type of jumper wire, but in this case, it consists of two male ends. It is mainly used to connect to female pin headers such as linking componenents, or creating connections between a microcontroller and a breadboard.

  The <b> LED </b> stands for light-emitting diode which means it allows current to flow in only one direction called a "forward bias". Once that electrical current passes through the anode(+) to the cathode(-), it emits light. This may be useful for indicators or simply lighting in general.

  The last component is something familiar. We talked about how potentiometers are variable resistors, but now, we are dealing with a <b> fixed resistor </b>. As we learnt, resistors help prevent excessive current from flowing through components in a circuit. As it is fixed, it already has a set resistance value which is not bad. It just means we cannot change it.
